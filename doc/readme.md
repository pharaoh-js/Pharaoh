* `todo.md` is pretty self-explanitory.
* `chromium-flags.md` is a longish list of flags that chromium can take when launching
  * NW.js can take many of these, too--these might be useful for us, specifically
* `examples` directory:
  * non-codemirror version works fine
  * two versions with codemirror _almost_ work just fine
  * saving-jq version is from a demo based on a csv issue or somesuch
  * editor in `examples/editor` works just fine, but is using cm 2 and `node-fs`...
  * `failed` directory is a bunch of little non-working attempts using `app/menu/Menu.jsx`
